# Definition
## Radio broadcasting 
Radio broadcasting is the transmission of audio (sound), sometimes with related metadata, by radio waves intended to reach a wide audience.

## Broadcasting
Broadcasting is the distribution of audio or video content to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model.

# History of radio technolology
## Maxwell’s prediction
  1864: James Clerk Maxwell proved: 
  + Any electrical disturbance could produce an effect at a considerable distance from the point at which it occurred
  + Electromagnetic energy could travel outward from a source as waves moving at the speed of light.

## Heinrich Hertz and radio-wave experiments
 Hertz's Experiment:
   + 1 spark gap at the centre of a parabolic metal mirror
   + Another spark gap connected with a wire ring: 1.5m away at the focus of another parabolic collector (in line with the first)
   + Obserse: A spark jumped across the first gap => A smaller spark jumped across the 2nd gap
   => Heinrich Hertz showed that:
      * The waves travelled in straight lines
      * They could be reflected by a metal sheet

## Marconi’s development of wireless telegraphy
  Marconi's Experiment: (repeated Hertz’s experiments with small modifications)
    + One side of the primary spark gap: attached to an elevated wire (antenna)
    + Other side: attached to Earth
    => The distance between transmitter and receiver was gradually increased ( max: 3 km)
    + The secondary-spark detector: replaced with a coherer (invented by Edouard Branly in 1890)
    => Maximum distance reached 3200 km

## The Fleming diode and De Forest Audion
  + 1904:  Sir John Ambrose Fleming invented the diode
  + 1906:  Lee De Forest invented the Audion.

## Early research by commercial companies
  + First commercial company to be incorporated for the manufacture of radio apparatus: the Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company, Ltd. (July 1897)
  + 1912: Lee De Forest discovered the oscillating properties of his Audion tube
  => Spark transmitter was replaced by electronic tube oscillator (=> generate much purer radio waves of relatively stable frequency)
  + 1910: 
    - radio messages between land stations and ships had become commonplace
    - the first air-to-ground radio contact was established from an aircraft
  + 1915: the American Telephone & Telegraph Company successfully (the first) transmitted speech signals from west to east across the Atlantic (between Arlington, Virginia, and Paris)
  + 1948: electron tube was invented

# Means of broadcasting
Broadcasting transmission (sound and television) uses both wires and radio waves (wireless).

## Amplifiers

## Antennas

## Transmission lines

# Broadcast Models

There are 4 types of broadcast models : 1.Flat Model 2.Circular Multi Disk Model 3.Multi Disk Model 4.Skewed Model

## Flat Model 
1. The server broadcasts the data as per cyclic requests without taking into account the number of devices that subscribe to a particular record. 
2. Flat disk has the best expected performance for uniform page access probabilities.

## Circular Multi Disk Model 
1. Each block of records pushed with a repetition rate proportional to its hierarchical level 
2. Record blocks R0,R1,R2,R3,R0,R1,R2,R3 transmitted in a single broadcast cycle. 
3. All record blocks have an equal priority level.

## Multi Disk Model 
1. Here broadcast is structured as multiple disks of varying sizes, each spinning at various rates. 
2. Consider the below example where page A was stored on a single page disk and that is spinning twice as fast as the second two-page disk containing pages B and C.

## Skewed Model 
1. In this model subsequent broadcast of more important data is clustered together. 
2. The data items are organized into the disks depending on their respective frequencies of access. 
3. The data items most frequently accessed are placed in the fastest disk and least accessed in the slowest disk.
4. Expected waiting time for data with less importance is much higher than that of important data. 
5. For skewed access probabilities, non-flat programs are better.
